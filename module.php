1.CAPTCHA

A CAPTCHA is a challenge-response test most often placed within web forms to determine whether the user is human. The purpose of CAPTCHA is to block form submissions by spambots, which are automated scripts that post spam content everywhere they can. The CAPTCHA mo
dule provides this feature to virtually any user facing web form on a Drupal site.

2. reCAPTCHA

Uses the reCAPTCHA web service to improve the CAPTCHA system. Tough on bots. Easy on humans.


3. Security Kit

SecKit provides Drupal with various security-hardening options. This lets your mitigate the risks of exploitation of different web application vulnerabilities.
SecKit facilitates certain mitigations for Cross-site Scripting, Cross-site Request Forgery, and Clickjacking, among other issues.


4.Password Policy

This module provides a way to enforce restrictions on user passwords by defining password policies.
A password policy can be defined with a set of constraints which must be met before a user password change will be accepted. Each constraint has a parameter allowing for the minimum number of valid conditions which must be met before the constraint is satisfied.

11.  Key

Key provides the ability to improve Drupal security by managing sensitive keys (such as API and encryption keys). It gives site administrators the ability to define how and where keys are stored, which allows the option of a high level of security and allows sites to meet regulatory or compliance requirements.
